Contributing
------------

Follow the steps below to create a new feature branch and push it to github.

```bash
# 1. Create a new branch from master
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b feature-sound

# 2. Add your changes to your new branch
git add .

# 3. Commit your changes to your new branch
git commit -m "something important"

# 4. At this point, your new branch is only known to you!
#    Make it public by pushing your branch to github.
git push -u origin head
```

Lastly, once github.com knows about your branch, go to github.com and submit a "Pull Request" of your branch into the master branch.
